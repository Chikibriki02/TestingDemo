This test project is designed to showcase my automation testing skills, covering key scenarios commonly encountered in the testing process. It includes both UI and API tests, written using SpecFlow and NUnit, and executed in the Chrome browser.

Technology Stack : 

SpecFlow: For defining test scenarios in Gherkin language, allowing adherence to BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) principles.
NUnit: Testing framework for running tests.
Selenium WebDriver: For automating actions in the Chrome browser.
POM (Page Object Model): For structuring UI tests and improving maintainability.
REST API Testing: For verifying interactions with APIs.
